# bevy

This is just the [Bevy sprite example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/examples/2d/sprite.rs), with a `#[bevy_main]` attribute on `main`.

To run this on desktop, just do `cargo run` like normal! For mobile, use `cargo android run` and `cargo apple run` respectively (or use `cargo android open` and `cargo apple open` to open in Android Studio and Xcode respectively).
